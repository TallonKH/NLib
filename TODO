Libraries
- multi lerp (nums and colors)

Viewport
- combine all register/unregisters into a map of registries
    ie: instead of `registerMouseListeningObj(obj)`, have `registerObj("MouseListening", obj)`
    also: do this for pre/post listeners
- add ability to specify ticking order
? add ability to supply custom data to event-registered objects
    ie: on click, an object could supply *where* it was clicked for future reference
    but: maybe don't need, as the object can just track this info itself
