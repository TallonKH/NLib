Viewport
- add way to limit pannable area
-- option to choose between (min fit) and (max fit)
--- (min fit) means that the entire canvas always fits within the div
--- (max fit) means that the canvas always fills the div (requires panning to view whole canvas)
- fix drag threshold to use screen-space delta instead of viewport-space

Libraries
- multi lerp (nums and colors)
- easing functions
